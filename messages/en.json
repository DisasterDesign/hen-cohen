    "bio1": "I value honesty.\nSimplicity.\nThe kind of truth that doesn't need to be exaggerated to be powerful.",
    "bio2": "I'm not drawn to spectacle or noise.\nI'm drawn to what's real — the quiet beauty inside everyday moments, the small details that most people overlook. That's where the emotion lives.",
    "bio3": "I'm deeply curious about people. I love watching someone open up in front of the camera, slowly recognizing themselves in a new way. There is something powerful about seeing someone feel proud of what they see on screen — and knowing I helped create that space.",
    "bio4": "As a director, cinematographer and editor, I'm involved in the entire process. I shape each story carefully, with clarity and intention. I know the value of what I bring — both creatively and professionally — and I don't take the trust you place in me lightly.",
    "bio5": "For me, filmmaking is not about exposure.\nIt's about connection.\nIt's about creating something meaningful that stays with you long after the screen goes dark."
